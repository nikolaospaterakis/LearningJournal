                <h1>Hi there! My name is Nikos and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
                <h4 class="light">
                    After several weeks of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path,
                     I've made the big jump and can create responsive sites for all the devices!
                </h4>
                </div>
                <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
                <p>
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner.
                     I used to spend hours and hours learning,
                      then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While that was fun,
                     I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                </p>
                <h3>How I got started</h3>
                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site.
                     I would take notes about what I was learning. 
                     After each learning session, 
                     I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    That helped me grok what I was learning,
                     and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
                </p>
